#SpringyRailsDemo

This is a very basic Ruby on Rails 3.2.8 application to demonstrate how to use a Canvas network graph with Ruby to represent Rails' Model Associations

The HTML5 Canvas Drawing code, the Javascript data model to store the graph nodes, and everything else Canvas-related is taken from the excellent [Springy Algorithm](https://github.com/dhotson/springy) by Dennis Hotson.

This demo is meant as an example of how to transform your models and your associations into a set of variables you can work with, and how to integrate these variables with the drawing Javascript code in the view.
